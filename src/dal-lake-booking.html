            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <article>
            <div class="article-1">
               <p>Dal is a lake in Srinagar, the summer capital of the
                Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir in the disputed Kashmir
                region.[1] It is an urban lake, the second largest lake in Jammu and
                Kashmir, and the most visited place in Srinagar by tourists and
                locals. It is integral to tourism and recreation in the Kashmir valley
                and is variously known as the "Lake of Flowers",[2] "Jewel in the
                crown of Kashmir"[3] or "Srinagar's Jewel".[4] The lake is also an
                important source for commercial operations in fishing and water plant
                harvesting.[5][6][7] The shore line of the lake, about 15.5 kilometres
                (9.6 mi), is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens,
                parks, houseboats and hotels. Scenic views of the lake can be
                witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh
                and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir,[8]
                and from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful
                shikaras.[9] During the winter season, the temperature can sometimes
                reach as low as −11 °C (12 °F), freezing the lake.[7][10] The lake
                covers an area of 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi) and is part of a
                natural wetland which covers 21.1 square kilometres (8.1 sq mi),
                including its floating gardens. The floating gardens, known as "Rad"
                in Kashmiri, blossom with lotus flowers during July and August. The
                wetland is divided by causeways into four basins; Gagribal, Lokut Dal,
                Bod Dal and Nigeen (although Nigeen is also considered as an
                independent lake).[11] Lokut Dal and Bod Dal each have an island in
                the centre, known as Rupa Lank (or Char Chinari) and Sona Lank
                respectively.[10][12] At present, the Dal and the Mughal gardens on
                its periphery are undergoing intensive restoration measures to fully
                address the serious eutrophication problems experienced by the lake.
                Massive investments of approximately US$275 million (₹ 11 billion) are
                being made by the Government of India to restore the lake to its
                original splendour.</p>
