            <article>
            <div class="article-1">
               <p>The Golden Temple (also known as the Harmandir Sahib (lit. 'House of
                God', Punjabi pronunciation: [ɦəɾᵊmən̪d̪əɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ]), or the Darbār
                Sahib, (lit. ''exalted court'', [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ] or Suvaran
                Mandir[2]) is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab,
                India.[3][4] It is the pre-eminent spiritual site of Sikhism. It is
                one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar
                Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur, and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana
                Sahib.[3][5] The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed
                by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.[6][7] In 1604, Guru
                Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the
                Golden Temple and was a prominent figure in its development.[3][8] The
                gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target
                of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and
                invading Afghan armies.[3][5][9] Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding
                the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, and overlaid
                the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to the name the
                Golden Temple.[10][11][12] The Golden Temple is spiritually the most
                significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a centre of the Singh Sabha
                Movement between 1883 and the 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement
                between 1947 and 1966. In the early 1980s, the gurdwara became a
                centre of conflict between the Indian government and a radical
                movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.[13] In 1984, Prime
                Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation
                Blue Star, leading to deaths of more than 1,000 soldiers, militants
                and civilians, as well as causing much damage to the gurdwara and the
                destruction of Akal Takht. The gurdwara complex was rebuilt again
                after the 1984 damage.[5] The Golden Temple is an open house of
                worship for all people, from all walks of life and faiths.[3] It has a
                square plan with four entrances, and a circumambulation path around
                the pool. The four entrances to the gurudwara symbolises the Sikh
                belief in equality and the Sikh view that all people are welcome into
                their holy place.[14] The complex is a collection of buildings around
                the sanctum and the pool.[3] One of these is Akal Takht, the chief
                centre of religious authority of Sikhism.[5] Additional buildings
                include a clock tower, the offices of the Gurdwara Committee, a Museum
                and a langar – a free Sikh community-run kitchen that offers a
                vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination.[5] Over
                150,000 people visit the holy shrine everyday for worship.[15] The
                Gurdwara complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
                and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.</p>
